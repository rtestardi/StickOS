	<font size="2">What people are saying about StickOS on the Web 
	and by e-mail:</font><ul>
		<li><font size="2">“I am simply amazed by what you have done with 
		StickOS Basic!&nbsp; It is the perfect solution for so many Micro 
		Problems!&nbsp; That you have done this on your own time and make it 
		available to hobbyist is incredibly kind of you!” – e-mail, James H., 25 
		Nov, 2011.</font><br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;I really LOVE StickOS. It’s by far the best robotic 
		programming language. Beats C, PBASIC, Arduino, and RobotSee. Takes me 
		back to the days of the Commodore PET and TRS80.&quot; -- e-mail, Brad S., 12 
		Sep, 2011.</font><br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;just love the stick os. so excellent. software at 
		its best.&quot; -- e-mail, Skip B., 23 June, 2011.</font><br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;I’ve been looking for a solution as clean as StickOS 
		for years! You’ve done a great job. I bought a couple of PIC32 from 
		SparkFun to play with StickOS. It’s amazing how easy one can put into 
		practice the crazy projects that were forgotten in the drawer… I’m 
		looking forward for the I2C support to play with the Nintendo Wii 
		remote.&quot; -- e-mail, Paulo L., 17 Aug, 2010.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;i have waited 30+ years for stickos. marvelous 
		stuff!!&nbsp; back in the old days, we did test instrumentation housed 
		in an ibm-pc, virtual instrument screen, and gw-basic programming.&nbsp; 
		too simple, maybe.&nbsp; i bought a parallax propeller board - the ntsc 
		capability did it, i guess. 8-cores, perhaps, but the spin language - 
		why?&nbsp; i was thinking, why not just embed basic as an operating 
		system - no mystery in telling ports how to behave.&nbsp; i tripped over 
		your videos - you could charm cobras. i bought two atria fr-jm-32 boards 
		as a result.&quot; -- e-mail, James J., 25 Jul, 2010.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;I just received my CUI32 and I would like to say 
		thank you so much for the superb StickOS! It is just great. I cannot 
		remember having so much fun playing around since back then on my C64. 
		And now BASIC on an embedded device -- amazing.&quot; -- e-mail, Markus G., 
		27 Apr, 2010.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;Works like a charm! I can access all my pins now. 
		When I bought my Cerebot 32MX4, I realized once I plugged it in and 
		started messing around that I was in way over my head. I had only played 
		with Arduino and PicBasic on some Pic16f84's. Looking at the demo led 
		flashing program example on MPlab had me perplexed and I had put the 
		board away with a confused look on my face. StickOS has opened the door 
		for me to explore all the possibilities and the power of the Pic32 as it 
		is more easy for me to understand. ... This is clearly going to blow 
		away anything I've done with my Arduino :D&nbsp; StickOS ROCKS!!&quot; -- 
		e-mail, Mark H., 17 Mar, 2010.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;I was able get StickOS up and running super fast and 
		had my first lines of code running in no time.&nbsp; I am very impressed 
		and wanted to thank you for writing the code! StickOS is awesome!&quot; -- 
		e-mail, 10 Feb, 2010.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">&quot;StickOS is a wonderful product and I am looking 
		forward to working with it. It will be a great asset in the academic 
		world. One of the charms of Arduino is the comparative ease of the 
		development cycle, but I think you have raised the bar by supporting 
		multiple targets and on-chip development.&quot; -- e-mail, 21 April, 2009.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
